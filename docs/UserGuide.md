![After successfully reopening](./images/tutorial/reopen.png)<br>

</div>

#### Must-Know: What Makes An Internship Unique

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
⚠️ **BEFORE YOU BEGIN!** 
<br>

A crucial concept to understand when using the application is to understand <br> **What Makes An Internship Unique**<br>

This will help you avoid confusion when creating internship entries and avoid creating duplicates! <br>

<br> The following is what makes an internship unique: <br>
**Company Name** <br>
**Contact Name** <br>
**Contact Email** <br>
**Contact Number** <br>
**Description** <br>
**Role** <br>
**Location** <br>

<br> In other words, an internship entry is considered a duplicate, if **all of the above fields** for the current 
internship entry and an already existing internship entry **are the same**!

</div>

applications now.

#### Finding internships by keywords: `find`

You can use this to filter the visible internships in CareerSync by keywords.

**Format:** `find MODE [/com COMPANY_NAME_KEYWORDS] [/poc CONTACT_NAME_KEYWORDS] [/loc LOCATION_KEYWORDS] [/status STATUS_KEYWORDS] [/desc DESCRIPTION_KEYWORDS] [/role ROLE_KEYWORDS] [/remark REMARK_KEYWORDS]`

* MODE is either 'withall' or 'withany'.
  * 'withall' returns internships that match each prefix-keyword predicate.
    * Within each prefix field that you specified, the internship just has to contain any of the keywords.
  * 'withany' returns internships that match at least one prefix-keyword predicate.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `google` will match `Google`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Microsoft Google` will match `Google Microsoft`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Goo` will not match `Google`
* Internship matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hewlett Song` will return `Hewlett Packard`, `Song Fa`

⚠️ **Common errors:** <br>

1. If you do not specify any field prefixes, or specified an invalid field prefix, the command will be rejected with error message:<br>
   `At least one supported field prefix and keyword must be specified to be searched.
   Supported prefixes are /com, /poc, /loc, /status, /desc, /role, /remark`<br>
2. Make sure you specify the MODE of search, which must be either `withall` or `withany`. If not, the command will be rejected with error message:<br>

## **Miscellaneous**
### FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Do the following steps: <br> 1. Navigate to the folder where CareerSync.jar is stored. <br> 2. Copy your data file from data/internshipdata.json. <br> 3. Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file (data/internshipdata.json) it creates with the file that contains the data (JSON file) of your previous CareerSync home folder.

### Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.<br>
**The solution** is to delete the `preferences.json` file from the folder where you installed the application. Then, run the application again.
